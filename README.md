# FinTech-Bootcamp-21  

This repository is a collection of weekly activities that I completed back in 2021 as part of an online bootcamp focused on Financial Technology (FinTech). Each week was a new topic, covering fundamental and more advanced concepts in FinTech, data analysis, financial modeling, blockchain technology and more. This bootcamp served as my introduction to programming and the wide world of tech. Hopefully most of the files and code still work!
